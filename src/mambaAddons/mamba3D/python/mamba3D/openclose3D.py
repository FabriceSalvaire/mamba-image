"""
This module provides a set of functions to perform opening and closing operations
on 3D images using mamba.

It works with image3DMb instances as defined in mamba3D.

All the closing and opening operation defined in this module use erosion,
dilation and build functions with user-defined edge settings. The functions
define a default edge which can be changed (see the modules erodil3D 
and geodesy3D).
