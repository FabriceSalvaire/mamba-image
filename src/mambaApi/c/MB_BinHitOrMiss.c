/**
 * Performs a binary Hit-or-Miss operation on image imIn using the structuring elements es0 and es1.
 * Structuring elements are integer values coding which direction must be taken into account.
 * es0 indicating which neighbor of the current pixel will be checked for 0 value.
 * es1 those which will be evaluated for 1 value.
 *
 * For example, in hexagonal grid, it means that if you want to look for a pattern where the neighbors in
 * direction 6 and 1 are true while the current pixel is false just as neighbors 2 and 5, 
 * you will encode this in the elements es0 and es1 like this :
 *   1 1
 *  0 0 0
 *   X X
 * es0 = 1+4+32
 * es1 = 64+2
 *
 * \param src output image
 * \param dest input image (must be different of src)
 * \param es0 structuring element for 0 value.
 * \param es1 structuring element for 1 value.
 * \param grid grid configuration
 * \return An error code (NO_ERR if successful)
