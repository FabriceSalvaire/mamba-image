"""
This module provides a set of functions to perform opening and closing operations
using mamba. it works with imageMb instances as defined in mamba.

All the closing and opening operation defined in this module use erosion, dilation
and build functions with user-defined edge settings. The functions define
a default edge which can be changed (see the modules erodil and geodesy).
