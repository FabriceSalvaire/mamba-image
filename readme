Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Mamba stands for MAthematical Morphology liBrAry. With it you will be
able to perform all the mathematical computations that are described
as morphological operations (erosion, dilatation, openings, etc...).
To work properly you will have to install PIL (Python Imaging Library).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
History
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The Mamba library is originated from a CMM 16-bit program known as Micromorph.
Micromorph worked on Windows systems and was renowned for its simplicity and 
educational abilities.

Mamba is a modernized, extended and free version of this software created
by Nicolas BEUCHER, with the help of CMM members, using a 32-bit port of 
Micromorph that was never released as a starting point.

Mamba retains all the key points of its predecessor adding new ones :

    - Portable, with support of multiple platforms and architectures
    - Simple
    - Fast
    - Fit for educational purposes
    - Free (through free licensing, see below)

Supported platforms
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Mamba works on the following platforms and python version :

    - 64-bit Linux
    - 32-bit Linux
    - Windows XP (32-bit)
    - Windows Vista (32-bit)
    - Windows Seven (32-bit)
    
The compatible version of Python are Python 2.6 and Python 2.7.

Currently Mamba is not working under 64-bit Python for Windows as the 
requested package PIL is not officially released for these platforms. 
You will need to install the 32-bit version of Python to use Mamba on a 
64-bit Windows platform.

Other platforms (macOS, UNIX, ...) are untested.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Build instructions (all platforms)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Compilation is ensured by Python distutils tools.

You will need the following tools :

 * Python version 2.6 or later with the distutils package.
 * Swig version 1.3.33 or later.
 * GCC version 4.3.0 or later (or its windows version MingW32)
 * Standard C libraries
 
 * Under Windows, you might choose Microsoft Visual C++ Express 2008 to compile
 you will then need the stdint.h header.

Make sure you have correctly installed the required tools and that
they appear in your PATH environment variable.

The following process works for all platforms :
    
    1 - Get the latest version of the source (package "Mamba.X.X.zip")
    2 - Extract it in your local directory
    3 - Browse to the created directory "Mamba.X.X"

=>To compile and install the Mamba library :
    1 - Browse to src/mambaApi
    2 - type :
    
        python setup.py build_ext build             (Linux)
        OR
        python setup.py build_ext build             (Windows with visual C++)
        python setup.py build_ext -cmingw32 build   (Windows with mingw32)
        
    3 - You can then install it.
    
        python setup.py install
    
Alternatively, you can create package/executable that will allow you to 
distribute the compiled library.

        On Windows :
        ############
        python setup.py build_ext bdist_wininst            (Windows with visual C++)
        python setup.py build_ext -cmingw32 bdist_wininst  (Windows with mingw32)
        then to install, double-click on the created exe inside the dist 
        directory.
        
        On Linux :
        ##########
        python setup.py build_ext bdist
        you can then find a package under the dist directory, extracting it will
        install the library in the correct path.
        
All the files are installed in the site-packages directory of your current 
python installation under directory mambaIm.

By default, the compilation is done without SSE2 except on Linux 64bit where 
basic gcc behaviour activates the SSE2. You can replace the setup script by
specific setup script that will produce more optimized version of Mamba for
your system (more information can be found inside the script setup.py).

For more options see the distutils documentation.
