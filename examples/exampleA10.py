## TITLE #######################################################################
# Analysis of the distribution of boron fibers

## DESCRIPTION #################################################################
# This example illustrates the judicious use of connectivity measures for
# solving a problem of quality control. The images represent boron fibers in
# a composite material. These fibers reinforce the mechanical resistance of
# the material. The resistance increases in proportion of the evenness of
# the fibers layout. Therefore, during industrial production, they are as
# far as possible placed according to a regular hexagonal network. However,
# irregularities occur. The problem consists in quantifying these
# irregularities by means of an appropriate measurement.
# This example illustrates the use of the matplotlib library with Mamba
# (to run this example, you must install this library).
