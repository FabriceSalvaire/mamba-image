# Directional morphological operators in 12 or 16 directions

## DESCRIPTION #################################################################
# These transformations use linear structuring elements defined on standard or
# conjugate directions of the grid in use. These operators (erosion, dilation,
# opening, closing) are often useful to increase the accuracy of the detection
# and extraction of oriented objects in an image. The following operators can be
# used on an hexagonal grid (12 directions are available) or on a square one (16
# directions are defined). The directions coding is the same in both cases:
# direction 1 corresponds to the same direction as in the grid in use (12 o'clock
# for the square grid and 1 o'clock for the hexagonal one), the numbering
# increasing clockwise up to 12 or 16.

# This operator is used by the general directional erosion.

    be changed).
    Note that this operator is not equivalent to successive erosions by a doublet
