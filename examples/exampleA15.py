# Dislocations in an eutectic lamellar alloy

## DESCRIPTION #################################################################
# The problem addressed here is a problem of detection of dislocations in an
# eutectic lamellar alloy. This structure is characterised by a two-phase
# lamination with some discontinuities due to dislocations in the cristalline
# assembly. These dislocations induce loss of strength which is all the more
# important as their lengths are important. Moreover, the size of the cells 
# delimited by these dislocations is also important. This example shows that
# it is possible to build, by an appropriate sequence of operations, features
# which are not visible at the first sight.

    This operation performs the computation of the extremities (maxima of a
    geodesic distance function) and puts the result in imOut.
    'imIn' must be a binary image and 'imOut' is a 32-bit image containing the
    extremities and their geodesic distance to the centroid (allowing thus to
    sort them according to their distance to the center).
    If 'innerParticles' is set to False(default), the particles touching the
    edge are considered as extending outside the image window. Therefore, no
    extremity is detected on the edge of the image. If 'innerParticles' is True,
    all the particles are supposed to be included in the image, so extremities
