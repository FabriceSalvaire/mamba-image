## TITLE #######################################################################
# Extremities of particles

## DESCRIPTION #################################################################
# This example illustrates the use of a geodesic distance function to extract
# the extremities of simply connected particles (without holes). Firstly, the
# centroid of each particle is obtained with an homotopic thinning with a D
# structuring element (this centroid is a sufficient approximation of the
# geodesic center). Then a geodesic distance function of each particle without
# its centroid is computed, the geodesic space being the particle itself.
# Finally, the extremities correspond to the maxima of this geodesic distance.

def extremities(imIn, imOut, innerParticles=False, grid=DEFAULT_GRID):
    """
    This operation performs the computation of the extremities (maxima of a
    geodesic distance function) and puts the result in imOut.
    'imIn' must be a binary image and 'imOut' is a 32-bit image containing the
    extremities and their geodesic distance to the centroid (allowing thus to
    sort them according to their distance to the center).
    If 'innerParticles' is set to False(default), the particles touching the
    edge are considered as extending outside the image window. Therefore, no
    extremity is detected on the edge of the image. If 'innerParticles' is True,
    all the particles are supposed to be included in the image, so extremities
    may appear on the edge.
