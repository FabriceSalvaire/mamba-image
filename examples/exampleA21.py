# Traffic lanes segmentation

## DESCRIPTION #################################################################
# This example illustrates the use of two images of a traffic scene to segment
# the traffic lanes. Firstly, the mean of successive difference images is used
# to define lanes markers. This image indicates the regions of the scene where
# some motion occurs. The lanes markers are then dilated to generate the road
# mask. The size of the dilation depends of the vertical coordinate of each
# pixel in order to take into account the apparent metrics due to the
# perspective view.
# Secondly, the lanes are segmented. This segmentation is performed by a 
# watershed of a distance function generated from the ground markings extracted
# from the mean image of the scene (moving objects have been removed).
