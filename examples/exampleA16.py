## TITLE #######################################################################
# Segmentation of a heap of rocks for evaluating its size distribution

## DESCRIPTION #################################################################
# Measuring the size distribution of heaps of rocks is an important task for
# a quarry manager. This information is crucial to optimize the efficiency of
# rocks crushers. The best and fastest way to get this information is by means
# of an image of the rocks taken from the skip of a lorry or from a conveyor
# belt. However, obtaining the size distribution from the image is far from
# being easy. This example shows that the use of the ultimate opening operator
# allows to get not so bad results.

# The initial image is filtered by an alternate filter by reconstruction.

# The ultimate opening residual operator is applied to the image. In order
# to obtain results of better quality, operators with dodecagons are used.

# The granulometric image is extracted.

# This image is saved with a color palette.

# The flat zones of the granulometric image are extracted (these zones have
# a gradient equal to zero).

# The real size is compared to the size given by the granulometric function.
# When the real size is less than half the size of the granulometric function,
# the corresponding flat zone cannot be considered as a marker of a block.

# In this second part, we shall use the previous markers to segment the blocks
# in the heap of rocks.

# The gradient of the original filtered image is computed.

# In order to get a better result, we must also introduce markers for the
# background. These markers correspond the highest flat zones of the
# granulometric function.

# A small correction is applied to insure that blocks markers and background
# markers are not touching each other.

# To be sure that background markers mark only the background, they are reduced
