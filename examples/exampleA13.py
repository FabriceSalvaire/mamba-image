## TITLE #######################################################################
# Extraction of a stamped grid on a steel sheet

## DESCRIPTION #################################################################
# A regular grid has been printed on a steel sheet before its stamping.
# This example shows how the crossing points of this grid after stamping can be
# extracted. The new position of each point indicates its displacement during
# stamping and therefore the degree of stress exerted locally on the steel sheet.
