# Automatic thresholding using gradient

## DESCRIPTION #################################################################
# This example shows how to compute an automatic threshold value using
# the gradient, histogram and volume computations.

    Computes an automatic threshold image using the gradient.

    highly contrasted sets.
    It produces a binary image that sort of *segment* the two sets in two.

# Computing the automatic threshold image
autoThreshold(im, imbin)
# And saving it
# The resulting image has a black band on the right because
# Mamba padded the original image so its width is a multiple of 64
# for performance reasons. This has a no impact on the quality of the result.
# Also notice that the result is not a very good segmentation as different
# coffee grains are connected in a unique set.
