# Pellets separation in a 3D polyurethane foam

## DESCRIPTION #################################################################
# This 3D segmentation example shows that a process which has been designed
# for 2D images can be applied directly to 3D images thanks to availability in
# mamba3D module of operators which are the simple transposition of 2D operators.
# The initial image represents a foam made of polyurethane pellets. However,
# these pellets are so compressed that the separation walls between them have
# disappeared. Only corners at the junction of adjacent pellets are still
# visible. Nevertheless, it is possible to rebuild the separation walls with a
# procedure which is, in 3D, similar, indeed identical, to the approach used to
# segment coffee grains in exampleA2.py (coffee grains separation and counting).
