## TITLE #######################################################################
# Traffic measurement, vehicles detection and counting

## DESCRIPTION #################################################################
# This example is the sequel of example A21. It shows how to detect vehicles in
# a traffic image. Although the process uses a simple feature to characterize a
# vehicle (namely the shadow in front of each car), it is rather robust. The
# mean image of example A21 is used again and is subtracted from the current
# image. Then the maxima of the resulting image which are sufficiently high are
# extracted as vehicles markers.
# The other interest of this example comes from the fact that an adaptive linear
# opening is defined to filter the previous minima. The size of the filtering
# varies according to the position of each pixel in the image. This size is
# controlled by an image which has been generated with the mask of the road
# obtained in example A21.
