# Particles (coffee grains) separation and counting

## DESCRIPTION #################################################################
# This example shows how to separate touching or slightly overlapping
# particles (coffee grains in this example) in order to measure and count them.
# This example also illustrates how some small enhancements may deeply increase 
# the quality of the final result.
