## TITLE #######################################################################
# Area labelling and area opening

## DESCRIPTION #################################################################
# This example explains how particles can be labelled by their area with a fast
# algorithm which does not use a particle analysis. It uses look-up tables to
# achieve this. Getting instantaneously all the particles with an area lower
# than a given value is made by a simple threshold of the result image. This
# operator allows to obtain area openings of the initial image. This operator is
# applied to an image of bubbles in Champagne wine.
# Initial image, courtesy of 0. Lordereau, Dept of Physics, Rennes University).
