## TITLE #######################################################################
# Quality control of a clutch device

## DESCRIPTION #################################################################
# This example explains how a clutch device can be checked by computer vision.
# Two pieces are controlled in the process: a star-shaped spring at the center
# of the device and a seal surrounding the casing. The first one can be damaged
# (missing branches) and the second one can be missing. This example shows how
# the regions where these pieces are supposed to be can be emphasized by a
# geometrical and topological approach.

    this operator checks the spring and the seal of a clutch device in 'imIn'.
    'springBranches' contains the branches of the spring which have been
    detected and 'sealZone' contains the region where the seal should be. This
    latter image is empty if the seal is present.
    This procedure returns a 2-item 'check' list. 'check[0]' indicates if the 
    spring is OK (1) or not (0). 'check[1]' indicates if the seal is missing (0)
    or not (1).
